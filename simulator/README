This directory contains the source files for the stack machine simulator.
It also contains several assembly language files for the stack machine
which may be used to test the simulator.

Building the simulator:

Unix/Linux:

To build the simulator, issue the command "make sim" (unix/Linux). This
builds the simulator executable "sim". The command "make clean" will
remove the object files generated during the build. The command "make
veryclean" will remove all the object files and the executable as well.


Win32 using the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler and associated tools:

First check to see if the supplied "Makefile" matches the file 
"Makefile.microsoft".  If not, copy "Makefile.microsoft" to "Makefile".
Then issue the command "nmake sim.exe". The command "nmake clean" will 
remove the object files generated during the build. The command 
"nmake veryclean" will remove all the object files and the executable 
as well.


Win32 using the Borland C/C++ 5 compiler:

First copy the file "Makefile.borland" to Makefile. Then issue the 
command "make sim.exe" to build the simulator executable. "make clean"
removes all the object files and "make veryclean" removes the executable 
as well.


Testing:

The files with extension ".asm" are the assembly language test files
for the stack machine simulator. Some of them (test.asm, test2.asm)
merely check that the simulator program can read assembly language files,
they do not represent valid programs. The file "test3.asm" is a trivial
program which subtracts 2 from 3 and prints the result. "Test4.asm"
is a WHILE-loop, "test5.asm" a branch instruction exerciser. The files
"test6.asm" and "test7.asm" served to test the behaviour of those
instructions involved with creating and destroying stack frames.
